Tools needed to run the program - 

- Python 2.7 interpreter
- Following python libraries are required to run the code
	- numpy
	- matplotlib
	- scipy
- All these libraries can be downloaded from - http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/

How to run the code - 

- The main files of the project are contained in the folder src
- They are named kmeans and gaussianMixture respectively to denote the kind of clustering done by both the files.

Running KMeans Clustering - 
- Run the kmeans file.
- Choose which dataset you want to run by appropriately choosing the dataset in line 13 of the file
- The value of K and the intial value of the means can be updated in line 14 and line 19 of the kmeans file.

Running the Gaussian Mixture Model Clustering -

- The dataset to be run can be changed in line 19 of the file gaussianMixture.py
- The value of K can be set in line 16
- The initial value of the means can be set at line 25-27
