SVM-VehicleData
===============
The program accomplishes multi-class classification using Support Vector Machines. We build a binary classifier, by
building a SVM using quadratic programming and then extend to to multi-class data, using error correction codes.
The codes have been designed with the appropriate Hamming distance between each code. The multi-class classifier has
been tested on the Vehicle Dataset(the dataset is available on the UCI Machine Learning Data Corpus).
